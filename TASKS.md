## Completed Tasks
- Create a working app2.py script using Streamlit (Completed on 5/16/2025)
- Investigate auto-selection of chatbar input on page load in app2.py (Completed on 5/16/2025)
  - Note: After multiple approaches, it was determined that auto-focus is not supported in Streamlit. Added clear instructions for users to click in the input field instead.
